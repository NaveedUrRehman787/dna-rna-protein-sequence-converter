# Title: DNA to Protein Converter App

Description:
This Streamlit app allows you to perform various conversions related to DNA sequences. You can effortlessly convert DNA sequences into protein sequences (amino acids), RNA sequences, as well as convert RNA sequences back into DNA and protein. Whether you're a biologist, bioinformatician, or simply curious about genetic sequences, this app provides a user-friendly interface to carry out these conversions seamlessly.

## Features:

  -  Convert DNA sequences to protein sequences (Amino Acids).
  -  Convert DNA sequences to RNA sequences.
  -  Convert RNA sequences to DNA sequences.
  -  Display the resulting protein sequences corresponding to the input DNA or RNA sequences.

## Usage:

   - Input your DNA sequence into the provided text box.
   - Choose the desired conversion option from the dropdown menu.
   - Click on the "Convert" button.
   - The app will display the converted sequence in the output section.
   - For DNA to protein conversion, the corresponding amino acid sequence will be shown.

## Installation:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NaveedUrRehman787/dna-rna-protein-sequence-converter.git
```

## Navigate to the file directory
```bash
   cd dna-rna-protein-sequence-converter
```
## Install the required dependencies using pip.
```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Run the streamlit
```bash
  streamlit run app.py
```
## Example
  - Input the a sequence
```bash
  ATGGTCTACATAGCTGGA
```
## Outpus
 ```bash
 MVYLS
```

**Note**: Ensure that your DNA sequences consist of valid nucleotide bases (A, T, G, C) and are in the correct format.
